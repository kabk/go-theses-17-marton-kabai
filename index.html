                            <p >In my thesis, I am trying to elaborate on the question: What are the consequences of the posthuman condition in graphic design. I am attempt to argue in favor of the resisting and reflecting ability that (graphic) design possess in the age staggering disconnection between the irreversible environmental crisis and the increasing expansion of techno-capitalistic ideology. The human race become a destructive geological force - as the Anthropocene refers - altering the biosphere, changing climate, driving species to extinction caused by human activity. Anxiety, apocalypse, panic. Information technologies, smart algorithms facilitate as well as surveil our everyday life. Excitement, optimism, innovation. The overwhelming dominance of the techno-capitalist ideology conceals the terrific waste and violence that the production requires. Nature becomes the victim of the egoistic agenda of capitalist production.</p>

                            <p>This problematic situation is the starting point of the posthuman theory, that tries to redefine, relocate and reinvent what it means to be a human. The divide between nature and culture, body and mind is increasing, the human exceptionalism has to be exceeded. Time to think beyond the centrality of the man. Through the posthuman, I attempt to derive the necessity of a post-anthropocentric turn in which (graphic) design - whatever it means - might have a major role, since it has a direct link to social, economic and political discourse. It has a capability of transferring critical concerns by exploiting current technological facilities and theories. In search of the position of the posthuman designer that promotes resistance, questions the status quo, reveals truth, provokes awareness, reinvent making, I argue that design is a possibility to imagine, to speculate, to affect and to change.</p>

                            <p>I argue how design makes all that possible by demonstrating concepts, such as 'defamiliarisation' by Shklovsky or the 'aspect change' by Wittgenstein. I emphasise the importance of intersectionality as a key to look ourselves relational. I point out the fundamental necessity to reinvent design practice as self-critical and irrespective. I trying toI conclude with the necessity of finding non-designer peers to ally with from other fields of knowledge. We have to connect in the age of disconnection.

                                I have an inherent admiration towards the notion of wilderness. It recalls an infinite organic proliferating space, that I have never been and never will be that space. It inhabits unexpectedness and governed by instincts. Self-organising bodies are living in bloody, timeless balance. The multiplicity of proportions and desires generate differences that sustain life. Various beings and materials are exposed to the virtue of violent forces. Wilderness is beyond human perception, wilderness is anti-anthropocentric, because wilderness is immeasurable. Wilderness is the anti-thesis of design. A proof of itself, imperfect, infinite event, brutal freedom. The landscape of wilderness is unpredictable, but its multiple reality makes it endless and equal in terms of possibilities. However it was our first home, that nurtured us. Designers and artist of all kind must reach out to the wilderness as the symbol of inherent possibility to free and rewild ourselves in order to reinvent design.

                                Derric Jensen, environmental activist and writer does not agree with the chosen name, Anthropocene: &#8220;All of this is crucial, because perpetrators of atrocity so often attempt to convince themselves and everyone else that what they&#8217;re doing is natural or right. The word &#8220;Anthropocene&#8221; attempts to naturalize the murder of the planet by pretending the problem is &#8220;man,&#8221; and not a specific type of man connected to this particular culture.&#8221;<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>5</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">&nbsp;, Derrick (2006), Endgame: The problem of civilisation.

The pond itself does not exist for Narcissus; the trees and sky above the pond do not exist. All that exists is the gazer enrapt by his own image.&#8221;<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>6</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">&nbsp; T&#248;nnessen, Kristin Armstrong Oma, Silver Rattasepp, (2016), Thinking About Animals in the Age of the Anthropocene.

Due to wrong political and economic decisions, and the relentless resource exploitation has led to land degradation, water and air pollution, massive species extinction, sea-level and temperature rise causing fatal environmental and social consequences. Pope Francis, published an official encyclical letter, <i>Laudato Si&#8217; of the Holy Father Francis on Care for our Common Home,</i>  where he is expressing his anxiety towards climate change with strong critics on the unregulated capitalist production: &#8220;The violence present in our hearts, wounded by sin, is also reflected in the symptoms of sickness evident in the soil, in the water, in the air and in all forms of life.&#8221;<a class="footnoteContainer" style="color:red;"><sup>7</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref"><a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.pdf" style="color:red" target="blank">Francis, Pope, (2015), “The Holy See”, published on w2.vatican.va 24 May 2015</a></span> He continues, by reminding us, that &#8220;our very bodies are made up of her (Earth) elements.&#8221; It&#8217;s quite surprising turn, that the Holy Father Francis makes an anti-capitalistic statement, by this he empowering the global left.

                                It seems that we can’t get away recognising that we need a radical reconfiguration of everything that we – as civilisation – have become, however the opposite is happening as the status quo is being reinforced by the prevailing techno-capitalistic structure. The ever-increasing institutional dependency on automatization and smart algorithms is becoming standards. Without computational systems, there is no stock-exchange, no defence system, no university, no social media. Our lives have intimately fused together with smart devices and information technology, that makes us fundamentally addicted dependent. The google search is so much part of our everyday life, that is affecting how we learn, read, write or remember.

                                The transhumanism movement finds the human through the possibility of bio-technological evolution. It considers that the human body is obsolete, and can and should be enhanced, alter and modify in order to make a better fit into to our technologized reality. It thinks the opposite way, instead of questioning the concept of techno-capitalism, it questions the human in terms of potentiality, confirming the actual power relations. Transhumanist thinks optimistically and rationally, surrendering under intelligent technology, open society and self-transformation. As if the human body there would be no better than a machine, but the human mind is exceptional and transcendent. Consequently, bio-technological corporations become the definition of future as a kind of religious figure, providing and maintaining the transhuman image, which is substantially the commercial version of modern humanity. It profits and invests in the informational code of all lives. The informational code of life becomes the ultimate commodity, where the code possesses more privilege than its material manifestation. For instance, Monsanto owns the informational code of all grains, possessing new level of control over production and productivity. Life becoming mere extract, code, data, commodity. “It is no longer about designing the things in the environment around us but designing life itself from microorganisms to humans, yet as designers we devote very little time to reflecting on what this means.”<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>12</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Dunne, A, Fiona, R (2013), Speculative Everything.

                                The posthuman  is - as opposed to the transhuman - very sceptical and critical towards technology, and its capitalist ideology.

It would argue that the “most important question to ask about modern societies is therefore what understanding of human life is embodied in the prevailing technical arrangements.” <a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>13</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Feenberg, Andrew.

Beyond Anthropocentris, June 2016, p.106-115</span> Rosi Braidotti stresses that Darwin and the concept of human as a species is missing from our philosophical terminology. We have to try think beyond the centrality of the man, the limitation of anthropomorphism and the historical significance of humanism. We must take a distance from our species, our history, to rethink and erase ourselves from a different light. Braidotti refers to it as the post-anthropocentric turn, that is eventually anti-anthropocentric. Humanism has been long time part of a philosophical discourse. In the Renaissance, the Vitruvian Man’ s message by Leonardo da Vinci express a new image, that attempted to disconnect from the centrality of god into the centrality of the man. The drawing was a symbol, instead of god, ‘the man is the measure of all things’. But it was just the very beginning. The revolutionary humanistic turn happened in the age of Enlightenment, where Rene Descartes, with the motto of - I think, therefore I am - have begun a dualistic version of humanism.

                            </p>

                            <p>

                            By now in the dawn of the 21 century, the promises of the humanistic exceptionalism suggested have failed. Humanity has never been one. The human that classical humanism refers to is the white, heterosexual, taxpayer, male citizen, that excludes as much as its includes. The essentialism – the emphasis of the mind – went too far and has resulted the Anthropocene. It has produced extreme disconnection between body and mind, nature and culture as well as a “gap between information and materiality, discourse and matter, and thus the human and the nonhuman”.<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>15</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Donmez, Basak Agın, “Recent Approaches in the Posthuman Turn” Relations. Beyond Anthropocentris, June 2016, p.106-115</span> Braidotti claims that, the dualism is what the posthuman turn attempts to exceed with the philosophy of Foucault, who defined the matter as vital and self-organizing. Braidotti has an anti-humanist background, that is not to be misunderstood with misanthropy, it is an explicit rejection of transcendental humanism.<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>16</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Transcendental humanism in philosophy considers what is proper treatment of humans outside of nature and decides they have inherent rights, simply from being human. It is also positive that man is capable of transcending the material self and can also free himself from surrounding influences. An example of this is when he thinks about himself and his character traits as if two different people.</span> She refuse the dualistic, hierarchical theories altogether, “which disavow the ecological dimension”<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>17</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Braidotti, Rosi.

If we consider it as a design problem, we immediately realise that all of these terms, outlooks and ideologies are constructed and designed. But concepts that lasts too long are harder to abolish, change or question because its already defined the rules in which we are living. What Braidotti suggests, is as simple as to admit that we should be in control, not being controlled, especially in a design context. As Timothy Morton, states: “The Anthropocene is an anti-anthropocentric concept because it enables us to think the human species not as an ontologically given thing I can point to, but as a hyperobject that is real yet inaccessible.”<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>19</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Morton, Timothy. “Realist Magic Objects, Ontology, CausalityTimothy Morton.” (2013): 1–234.

Print.</span> Capitalism has drawn from areas of human knowledge, like science, psychology, perception, engineering, industry...etc in order to further its powerful economic system. Considering its connection with design to craft visual messages with fixed ideology (propaganda) was always an important addition to support this imperative. The history of graphic design is inextricably linked to that commerce and consumer production. But if design has a history linked to the generation of need, consumption and desire, it also linked to the generation of knowledge and information. At the level of a service industry, where most design have taken place, it exists only as form-giver not content provider, since forms are the real carriers of ideology. That stage has been long passed as Daniel van der Velden proposed, “today, an ‘important graphic design’ is one generated by the designer himself, a commentary in the margins of visual culture.”<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>21</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Daniel van der Velden,  “Research & Destroya Plea for Design as Research” Metropolis M, issue 2 2006</span>, defining a new trend or approach. Marx outlined ideology as a "false consciousness" of a ruling class in a society which falsely presents their ideas as if they were universal truth, a set of ideas used as a political tool to achieve hidden goals and interests by distorting social and political realities. That confirms that disconnection between critical and affirmative design that I am seeking to analyse. In fact, the history of graphic design is the history of form not the content, the problem however is that most commercial enterprises will not be interested in forms that reveal the true relations of the dominant economic and political systems, that could undermine its corporate status. Braidotti argues that there is a “tension between the urgency of finding new and alternative modes of political, ethical and social agency for our technologically mediated world and the inactivity of established mental habits on the other.” <a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>22</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Braidotti, Rosi. (2014), The Posthuman. Cambridge: Polity Press</span> This I understood as a tension between the only available agency that runs design production, where hypnosis takes place, and the other, selfanalogous, holistic, relational design practice outside of corporate interests that is active, dynamic and self-critical. “The post-anthropocentric turn, linked to the compounded impacts of globalization and of technology-driven forms of mediation, strikes the human at his/her heart and shifts the parameters that used to define anthropos.”<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>23</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Braidotti, Rosi.

                            <p>The crisis of dualism is the essence to open up the posthuman condition, that I would like to integrate and fuse into the possibility and potentiality of design. Emphasising how important and crucial is to recognise the capability of design in the age of despair, confusion and extinction. The posthuman turn that Rosi Braidotti offers “has come to denote a horizontal, rather than a hierarchical, alignment of the human and the nonhuman” and attempts to place this isolation between the body and mind, nature and culture into focus, as well as the disconnection between form and content, value and truth, society and politics. It is the age of ambivalence: panic and at the same time excitement. Design operates in two ways: form and content. Form is the materialistic, physical embodiment through various techniques and technologies.  Concept on the other hand is the virtual, the philosophical through, political or social interaction. Of course, these qualities intervene and mixed within design production. I am curious as to what extent the posthuman condition affects design, the role of a designer and what are the consequences of it?  What is to be offered in terms of possibilities of acting politically through design and how does one become a posthuman designer?</p>

                                <p>Ideology and design have always been close to each other. Design is itself an ideology and a tool that makes ideology possible, as it can materialise and organise ideas. We know some cases, where design has led to ideology, like the 20th century design/art movements (Dadaism, Surrealism, Suprematism) which has made possible the ability to see and to live in alternative realities and imaginations. But their reason was to deny the ruling horrific political ideologies of their environment. On the other hand, where ideology becomes art and design, is the manifestation of propaganda. The idea of multiplicity, instead of the rigid belief in one view as some ideologies and much propaganda tends to determine. Ideologies in most cases designed by the few for the masses to get control, however it’s not impossible to transform its facility against the powerful. We have just encountered a similar duality, – the multiplicity contra the one. How can we defend ourselves or recognise ideologies? Images can be crafted to mislead, control the behaviour of the viewer, but the same image can be shown in a different light that could undermine the previous suggestion. Design is the possibility to choose and to recognise the responsibility of the message. Wittgenstein’s term, “aspect change” is explains the fragility of human perception and defines fundamental multiplicity over monotheism. He explains it by using Jastrow’s picture of duck-rabbit or rabbit-duck head. </p> <img src="img/chapter2/img3.png"><div class="image-caption"><p>Jastrow’s Duck rabbit drawing</p></div> <p>The reason why this drawing is symbolic, is because when first we see it, we see only one animal head – either the rabbit or the duck – but If somebody show us a different arrangement of connections between the elements on the picture, we might see the other head as well. This moment Wittgenstein calls an “aspect dawning” – the phenomenon of suddenly seeing something else at the same picture. Suddenly we experience multiple meaning of the same image. Rasinski explains very clearly why this is important in our case. “I want to suggest here that the change of aspect, aspect dawning and perspicuous representation are possible means of defending ourselves against ideology, against the terror of violent design. Therefore, we have to seek for providing new, alternative “maps” for the familiar problems or paradigms. Such “maps” have a capacity to liberate us from pictures that “hold us captive” by opening up a space of freedom, that is, by pointing at possibilities of thinking, acting or governing otherwise. “<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>24</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Rasinski, Lotar. “A Picture Held Us Captive...” Marx, Wittgenstein and the ‘Paradox of Ideology’. 2016.

                                Viktor Shklovsky has a similar approach. In his essay, Art as technique, talking about art as “defamiliarisation”. He argues, that art and design is technique, that able to change ordinary perceptions. When we get used to something it can easily outpace us and become autocratic.  When a product, a colour, a shape, a path or a way of thought becomes familiar and stays unchanged, we tend to take it granted, fixed and absolute. “Habitualization devours work, clothes, furniture, one's wife, and the fear of war. If the whole complex lives of many people go on unconsciously, then such lives are as if they had never been.”<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>26</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Shklovsky, Viktor. “Art as Technique.”, 1912: p.1–11</span> Thus, based on Shklovsky idea, art and design is capable of demystify seemingly complicated social and political issues. Therefore, we can see a benefitting relation between design and critical thinking. Shklovsky is basically connect the power of “aspect change” as a technic of art and design. “Art exists that one may recover the sensation of life; it exists to make one feel things, to make the stone stony. The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known.” <a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>27</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Shklovsky, Viktor. “Art as Technique.”, 1912: p.1–11</span> So the purpose of art is to make objects, feelings or thoughts unfamiliar, to make forms out of its contents, to increase the difficulty and length of perception in order to shaken the viewer out of his social role. Shklovsky reinforcing the function of criticality in design and art, in favour of a new vision over the old.  Design can be also seen as a funnel. What I mean by this is that design can take viewers by its familiar form, like a book or a website and in a way, trap them into being confronted an opinion, confusing their perception or acting. But also, that from the moment this becomes clear, there’s almost no way out. Design make us shiver.

                                Problems never stands alone, always in contrast, intersecting with each other to become much more challenging to see through. There is no design without technology, psychology or ethics. As Braidotti emphasises a monistic, plural, inter-relational condition, we have to also acknowledge that design is first and foremost a practice, a translational tool that requires peers, theorists and experts to understand its intersectional quality. Kimberlé Crenshaw coined the term “intersectionality” as a way of understanding and speaking about complex interactions between different forms of oppression. How can we talk about racism, without mentioning misogyny or xenophobia? How can we talk about the beauty of nature without the global consequences of advanced capitalism? Intersectionality is a conceptual tool with which issues, problems, roles are in continuous interaction with each other. Design is also a vector, intersecting a multiplicity of many forces – political, economical, social, cultural, experiential, institutional. As a force “it participates to the construction of the future”.<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>28</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Denker, Kai. “CfP: Deleuze and Design (Deleuze Connections Series) - Review.” (2012): 1–3. Print.</span> It also refers back to Rasinski’s “map”, that is not fixed and absolute, but dynamic and can and must be refreshed, redrawn, remade over time. “Intersectionality teaches us that politics cannot be only understood through rigid power categories but through a matrix of forces and relations that produce different effects in different sites and moments, with different bodies and positions.“<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>29</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref"><a href="Article at http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/announcements/2016/call-for-papers-intersectional-perspectives-on-design-politics-and-power-a-two-day-symposium/"></a>Article at http://www.decolonisingdesign.com</span></p>

                                I already concluded that everything slowly continues to transition through intersectional paths and the role of a designer is not an exception. Concluding that in design industry there is limited space for imaginative design in an industry biased by capitalistic ideology, however that’s pays off well in terms of €, £, $. Some designers have recognised its confusing, ambivalent context and started expanding borders, both of form and concept. As Van Toorn expresses, “not questioning social responsibilities (of the designer), implies that you surrender to that sector of society, that because it possesses all our means of survival, manoeuvres design in the role of entrepreneurial aesthetics”. In 1964, the First Thing First manifesto published by Ken Garland together with 21 colleague to “reject the “high pitched scream of consumer selling” and omnipotent lure of the advertising industry in favour of what was defined as socially useful graphic design work”<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>30</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Howard, Andrew. “There Is Such a Thing as Society*.” (2016): 1–12. Print.</span> . It was a brave attack against the standardisation of advertising industry, but what makes it more interesting is that it has been republished and revised by Adbusters as the First Things First Manifesto 2000. “The aim was to stimulate discussion in all areas of visual communication – in education, in practice, in the organisations that represent design’s aspirations and aims – as well as outside design.”<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>31</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Barnbrook, Jonathan et al. “First Things First Manifesto 2000.” (2016): 1–5.

                                In 2006, Daniel van der Velden goes a bit further, with his text, Research and destroy. He realises that the role of a designer has to change, redefined, reinvent in accordance to the changing times. He argues, that graphic design is more than surface production, more than a service, “In recent years, the graphic designer has shown himself as (more the graphic designer) artist, editor, author, initiator, skilful rhetorician (or even) architect. The ambition of the designer always leads beyond his discipline and his official mandate.”<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>32</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Daniel van der Velden,  “Research &amp; Destroya Plea for Design as Research” Metropolis M, issue 2 2006</span> He wants out from the “traditional”, “familiar” framework and objective, historical definition of graphic design. Shklovsky and Wittgeinstein and might Braidotti would all confirm its change and calls, but the subject of change is not smaller than design and the designer itself. The proposal resonates in many levels, political, social, psychological, philosophical, but first and foremost it’s about resumption and reinvention of the form together with the content. Becoming holistic, relational and self-analogous. The posthuman designer proposes a new vision, a new arrangement, and calls for becoming the transition itself, refusing and detaching from the corporate, corrupt world, which is also a resignation from fame and financial wealth in our  “With the removal of need and the commissioned assignment as an inseparable duo, the door is open to new paths.</p>

They define design as possibility to make and alter existing worlds and world views. Accepting design as ideology as well as ideology as design.  They coined the confusing term: “critical design”, but not as fixed and absolute, rather than a thinking method, an attitude or position to begin with. They place technology their critical focus, “to question, critique, and challenge the way technologies enter our lives and the limitations they place on people through their narrow definition”<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>34</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Dunne, A, Fiona, R (2013), Speculative Everything.

Cambridge: MIT Press</span> is also a central issue in Braidotti’s view, when she is expressing her deep concerns towards the underrated power of techno-capitalistic interests. The design that produces such things, they call “affirmative design” that reinforces the actual status quo. What Daniel van der Velden suggest to “redesign himself” is what Dunne &amp; Raby attempt to target. “Critical designs are testimonials to what could be, but at the same time, they offer alternatives that highlight weaknesses within existing normality.”<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>36</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Dunne, A, Fiona, R (2013), Speculative Everything.

                                    The design industry in most cases is contributing in some extent to symbolic violence, which is another reason to redefine making. Making is acting. Actions are made up from sequence of decision, design is not ends when we leave the studio or when we finish a project. Design takes place in all of our decisions. It is not different, when we eat, dress, travel or buy goods. We have free will to design our choices. I consider design refusing to consume, partake or buy any kind of products, that based on violence, exploitation especially referring to animals. I am not separating design from everyday moral obligation, I consider veganism as a design movement done by mostly non-designers. The ideology that it represents has enormous relevance to the post-anthropocentric condition. Veganism as a form of design practice is necessary to learn sacrifice and to understand life and death. Basically we have no knowledge and necessary public discourse about death. In the former solder, Roy Scanton’s important book, Learning to die in the Anthropocene, he points out that death is the synonym of grief, pain and sorrow, instead of look at it as destination, as possibility, as motivation. “…the practice of learning to die is the practice of learning to let go: Learning to die means learning to let go of the ego, the idea of the self, the future, certainty, attachment, the pursuit of pleasure, permanence, and stability. Learning to let go of salvation. Learning to let go of hope. Learning to let go of death.”<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>44</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Scranton, Roy (2015), Learning to Die in the Anthropocene, San Francisco: City Lights Publishers</span></p>

                                    Design has been a synonym of doing, making or building I would like to argue that it is also undoing, unlearning, unmaking. It is a way of reinventing, redesigning the making. Veganism is a denial of the “agrilogistical”<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>45</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref"> Morton, Timothy (2016), What is Dark Ecology?: For a Logic of Future Coexistence, Columbia Univeersity Press</span>, capitalist values and becomes an existential protest, a live manifesto in itself. One of the case studies of undoing can be very literary by erasing. The Australian artist Christian Capurro's project the Another Misspent Portrait of Etienne de Silhouette, using the act of erasure creating new meaning. It is not similar to destroying, it is closer to making. There is an undeniable reference to Rausenberg - Erased de Kooning drawing, but here we have a context of a Vogue magazine, a pop-cultural design product that emphasises the inevitable link to consumption. The symbolic act of removing the content of all pages, took long years by many people. It was also emphasised as labour, mentioning how long it took to erase. The artist of course payed an hourly rate.  The front and back covers of the magazine, though noticeably worn by years of scuffing, remain un-erased.

One of the early example is The Whole Earth Catalog (1974) by Stewart Brand, using elaborate research method to gather the content of the magazine, that can foreshadow the internet of things. “The true investment is the investment in design itself, as a discipline that conducts research and generates knowledge – knowledge that makes it possible to seriously participate in discussions that are not about design.“<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>46</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref"> Yesomi Umolu, “Eyal Weizman and Architecture as Political Intervention.”, Walker, September 21, 2012, p.1–10.</span> One of my main example of this section of investigative design is the UK based Forensic Architecture. They investigating war-crimes by using project based forensic research methods, that uses advanced information-technology to provide truth and justice on the court hearing. It is not self-expression, it is bloody serious real-life story-telling, without mistakes. Eyal Wizman, the founder of the collective notes: “We actually unearthed its original meaning by reconstructing the genealogy of the term (forensics)— returning to the notion of forensics as “the art of the forum.”<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>47</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref"> Yesomi Umolu, “Eyal Weizman and Architecture as Political Intervention.”, Walker, September 21, 2012, p.1–10.</span> Joining design and art to its serious characteristic.

Ruben using the technique of “disguise” and also “aspect change” to reveal the true relations of images, stories, leaders or typefaces that is not what they seem like. Untold stories, secrets, under coverings. The project by Metahaven, The Sprawl (2016), the propaganda about propaganda, dealing with the ideology as design as well as design as ideology. They use speculative designs to debate potential ethical, cultural, social, and political implications as well as using significant visual story-telling.Metahaven is one of the first studio that recognised the graphic design practice as a form of everything and nothing, as a form of resistance and displacement.

                                Provocation, distraction, embarrassment was all part of the 20th century Avant-Garde movements such as Dadaism as symptomatic consequences of the time.  “Safe ideas will not linger in people’s minds or challenge prevailing views but if it is too weird, it will be dismissed as art, and if too normal, it will be effortlessly assimilated If it is labelled as art it is easier to deal with but if it remains design, it is more disturbing; it suggests that the everyday life as we know it could be different, that things could change.”<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>51</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref"> Dunne, A, Fiona, R (2013), Speculative Everything. Cambridge: MIT Press</span>  Provocation stands for the scale of belief on what we consider real. Good design is inherently provocative, through defamiliarization. Lifting up the skirt of truth can be very provocative and painful for average citizens, but “sometimes we can have more effect as citizens than as designers. Design can help raise awareness of the consequences of our actions as citizen-consumers”. Renzo Martenz documentary film is a great example of rising global uncanniness. Enjoy poverty - episode III, (2008) guide us through the landscape of poverty in Congo, watching the protagonist making western statements about how the global west exploits and profits from deep poverty. The film is autoreferential, does not give any hope, just a glimps of reality is shown throughout the plot. Poverty is constructed and maintained. The film provokes a realisation, that charities helping as much as exploiting. I have also responded with a book, Poverty Porn, (2016) where I created a double narrative; an image sequence on how charity adverts interprets poverty, and a text sequence that’s hidden behind the images. Each image page can be unfolded, which reveals a critical text, article or interview about how disgusting is the purposeful exploitation of the image of poverty. Janna Ullrich beautiful work, the A one week wonder, Monsanto’s imperium, imagines how many animals being slaughtered in order to feed thousands of passengers in a huge cruiser that is usually on water for weeks or months. She made an idealistic image of millions of farm animals grazing on an idealistic green land, and showing the fascinating cruiser at the back, as the final destination. Presenting a massacre in favour of the upper class, that affords to use the ship. One of my works: As if everything was fine, is a colouring book series, that maps the life of factory farm animals, such as pig, chicken and the cow, from birth until they become meal on the table. I wanted to show that the information on animal exploitation is available and not a secret what a horror is happening every day inside an agricultural factory. In oppose to the manipulation that most of the parents do with idealised farm-life colouring books, that stands very far from truth. Truth is becoming provocation, when it comes to children, we tend to protect them. But do we really protect them, by ignoring the truth and showing a fake reality or it is a way of prepare them what the actual system wants us to believe. Design is a tool that can flip heavy things over.

                                “In today’s economy it is as consumers that we have power. The most threatening act of protest for a capitalist system would be for its citizens to refuse to consume” <a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>52</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref"> Dunne, A, Fiona, R (2013), Speculative Everything. Cambridge: MIT Press</span>  Darkness as an antidote to naive techno-utopianism, the positive use of negativity. Dark design is driven by idealism, speculation and optimism. While we are more than ever aware of both the promise and the threat of technological advance, we still lack the intellectual awareness. Broersen&amp;Lukács film, the Establishing Eden (2016), presents and uncanny, mysterious sublime of the “corporate” nature of Hollywood movies. Without any extra narrative, the film turn into a trigger of becoming, however using only flat photographs in a 3D space, makes it very depressing and distant. Ed Atkins, Ribbons, 2014 shows a beautiful poetic work of something beyond human, beyond of our becoming. The protagonist is a 3D character, that feels like an empty model, being used to represents a narrative. Bjorn Melhus, in his movie, Captain (2005), tries to reconfigure and twist the early 80’s science fiction TV film aesthetics, by reproducing a space scene, with dialogues that extracted from films and tv shows. The work of the Paris based studio, Golgotha, Archaeology from the future, (2013), builds on a possible corporate future narrative, where the most valuable currency become the sperm itself. The work is speculating on a commercial of a Life-stock company, that promoting its new sperm products. The Uterus Man by LuYang explores a transhuman idea of the future super-woman, half organic, half machine, whose menstrual blood makes her so powerful that she can fly as a transhumanist heroine.

                                Allyship is about making friends, connecting the practitioner (designer) and theorist (scientist), The posthuman designer has to open towards various fields of studies, disciplines in search of new context, new vision and new collaborations to develop a new arrangement of working together. Finding our non-designer peers is essential for the posthuman context. The practice of developing ideas, and the practice of materialising possibilities complement each other. The Design Displacement Group (DDG) finds its core aspect in collaboration as part of its design or art practice. They regard themselves as a collective tribe of similar souls, that need each other to make the imagination come true. The group consists of various disciplines, like designers, coders, writers and scientists. Unfortunately, allyship is working only within a particular field of knowledge, but there is a lack of independent, voluntary cross collaboration between design and other disciplines. For instance, universities filled with scientists and researchers develop elaborate research projects, where in design, this approach is absolutely missing. Maybe they only exist in levels of necessities or standards, like 12pt Times font requirements. We have to initiate discourse with other fields, we have to be open for other methods, languages and cultures. We have to extends our western limitations and be much more open for becoming’s. We have to connect in the age of disconnection. </p>

                        <p>
                            Graphic design is in constant flux, since it has no fixed and absolute definition, shape or scale. However, I tried to approach it from the posthuman condition in which I considered design as a possibility to question, overthrown and reinvent the status quo. The Anthropocene can be seen just another reason to reinforce design as resistance, but its more than that. We have to declare, that it is a war and we are solders. The ambivalent situation of environmental collapse, the technological excitement, the failed promise of the man and the demagogue ideology of the economic system urge us to initiate change within the fixed and absolute.We have to connect with each other and reinvent ourselves and reinvent “making”. I argue that the posthuman designers must resist, investigate, question and dare to imagine to empower the sleeping resistance. It is a now-or-never situation. Desire is the ultimate drive for becoming, therefore “Intensive spaces of becoming have to be opened and, more importantly, to be kept open.” We as designers of the Anthropocene have enormous responsibility that will be weighed by time.

                            Graphic design is in continuous morphing and transforming in relation to everything else. The thing that is fixed is that everything is in a transition. Deleuze and Guttari look at design as “making worlds”, thus creating futures. There is an inherent post-critical, post-speculative focus in it, where design not by accident, but purpousfully goes against the “definition”. “Taken as a force, a disruption, and a process, design is here taken as the embodiment of possible worlds.”<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>53</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Marenko, Betti, (2015), Deleuze and design. Edinburgh University Press, p.1–35</span> To design means to engage with the new, thorough the old, the excluded, the possible, the potential, the impossible. It is about believing to able to affect reality with imagination as imagination is reality. “To design means always to engage with what is not-yet but could be.” <a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>54</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Marenko, Betti, (2015), Deleuze and design. Edinburgh University Press, p.1–35</span> Thus, the present emerges as the embodiment of a thought. “Every designed object contains in itself the seeds of future practices and future behaviours.” <a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>55</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Marenko, Betti, (2015), Deleuze and design. Edinburgh University Press, p.1–35</span> The work of art, they argue, “does not actualize the virtual event but incorporates or embodies it: it gives it a body, a life, a universe. These universes are neither virtual nor actual; they are possibles, the possible as aesthetic category.”

                            The sort of design practice that I would value is to be found in collaboration with other areas of self-critical and radical human and non-human knowledge, where we can combine and align our visual and cognitive skills to alternative, revolutionary aspiration. Considering recent political developments worldwide which appear to have fallen hostage to reactive social responses, more than ever we will need to establish communication systems and open our strong hearts that have the ability to enlighten, inform and inspire to action. Design has a duty and a mission with its “crucial role in the dreamworld of commodities”<a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>55</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Howard, Andrew. “Design Beyond Commodification / Article”, Eye magazine, issue 38, volume 10, winter 2000, p.1–6</span> creates and maintains “the symbolic connection between the power structures and our experience of reality.” <a class="footnoteContainer" ><sup>55</sup></a><span class="hidden footnote unclick" id="ref">Howard, Andrew. “Design Beyond Commodification / Article”, Eye magazine, issue 38, volume 10, winter 2000, p.1–6</span>

                        I would like to say special thanks to Rosi Braidotti, writing her book, The posthuman! It is the begining of something very big and deep. I would like to thanks to my wife, Natela Lemondzhava, supporting and believing me, the long discussins and the our home, that made possible to write this thesis. I greatly thankful to my cosmic friend, Tamás Toth, helping me understand the structure of the text and draw my attention to the important essay by Lotar Rasinski and suggesting terms like 'demistification' and 'directional intersectionality'; to Gabor Kerekes helping me coding the site, even when he was very busy with other things, and to my teachers, Marjan Brandsma &amp; Dirk Vis, trusting me, even when I was behind with schedule. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I am not consider this thesis a final, absolute text. It is a "navigational tool", "compass" and a manifesto, that tries to reinterpret and speculate on what would and should be the duty of today's designers.</p>
